# findance (pronounced: find ance)
A small-but-growing package for collecting data from Nasdaq and expanding upon the scope of the data using the Yahoo! Finance API which is nicely wrapped by the open source project [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance)

## Usage
To start, clone the repository. 
``` git clone https://github.com/austinjhunt/findance ```
Then, go to the [Nasdaq Stock Screener](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener), apply any filters you wish to apply to narrow down the scope to stocks you are interested in, and choose "Download CSV". 

Next, move that file you downloaded to the root of this project (or just make a note of its current path).
